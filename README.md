## Installation

The user will need to install node.js as well as the express.js package in order to run this application without going to the hosted deployed site. The application is deployed using Heroku at https://infinite-ravine-55754.herokuapp.com/.

## Usage

The user will be presented with the opening webpage which instructs the user to click the "Get Started" button in order to add notes.

The user will then be presented with the note taking page in which they can enter a heading and the corresponding notes they would like to add.

After the user adds their notes, they will click the save icon in the top right corner. The note will then be saved into a list on the left side of the screen.
